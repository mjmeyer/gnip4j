/**
 * <p>
 * Process Enterprise Data Collector streaming feed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The implementation is a bit hacky... It use regular expressions to detect the
 * begging and ending of the diferents activities.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Quoted from: <a href=
 * "http://support.gnip.com/customer/portal/articles/477770-consuming-data-via-the-enterprise-data-collector#STREAMING"
 * >Consuming Data via the Enterprise Data Collector</a> <blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Consuming XML Data
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Because data will continue to arrive over the same response stream you will
 * need to know when to process a particular chunk of data. When using the HTTP
 * stream Gnip sends the data over the stream with each activity as its own
 * "top-level" node. In other words, activities will not be wrapped in an
 * enclosing <results> element as they are during a normal poll.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Generally the best approach is to read the data and grab the opening element
 * (e.g. the <entry> element when the activities are coming across in Atom
 * format), then continue reading until you see the closing element for that tag
 * (</entry>). At this point you've got a fully valid Atom XML entry that can be
 * processed by any standard xml parser.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Chunking activities this way is the most straightforward means of processing
 * the stream.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, the following figure shows what a stream may look like when used
 * with a Twitter Actor - Notices data collector. In this example there are two
 * <status> documents. Using the approach outlined above, your stream client
 * would see the first <status> element, continue reading until it sees the
 * first </status> element, then process that chunk as a single XML document. It
 * would then continue reading at the second <status> element and process the
 * second document when it sees the second </status> element. </blockquote>
